# Casual Guide to Cleaning
Is your standard of cleanliness just "it doesn't *look* dirty, its fine"?
Getting complaints but not sure where to start?
Roommates you lived with before are Lovecraftian fish people from the London sewage?
In this **Casual Guide to Cleaning**, we channel our experiences in childhood trauma to give tips on how to clean properly!

## Dishes
Bacteria will stay alive on surfaces, even clean surfaces, for up to four days. When you leave dishes in the sink, you're building a concoction of bacteria soup.
Which can be the cause of a myriad of gastrointestinal problems. As a completely unrelated side note to bacteria and cross contamination, I get sick easily. *So no pressure, the blood is on your hands~*

When hand washing dishes: 
- Have the water as hot as you can bear (Or wear rubber gloves)
- Use detergent and some sort of scrub or brush so you are ***actually*** removing the food particles with brute force.
- **ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HAND ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE DISHES TO CHECK IF YOU CLEANED THEM PROPERLY!!!**
  - Feel Oily? WASH IT AGAIN
  - Feels a weird wet bump? THAT'S FOOD BITS STUCK ON IT
  - Feel Soapy? UNLESS YOUR DIET includes SOAP, WASH IT AGAIN
- Use a clean dish cloth

How to clean dish cloth: 
- Wash and rinse the cloth after washing it with cleaner
- Microwave for a minute

Wash your hands after touching the dishes, especially days old dishes. Don't cross contaminate.

## Cookware
**Nonstick:**
![Tips for Nonstick](https://cdn.kitchencabinetkings.com/media/siege/cleaning-pots-and-pans/cleaning-posts-and-pans-nonstick.png)

Nonsticks are great for beginners because they can easily be cleaned with hot water, dish soap, and a soft sponge. 
Soaking Nonsticks in soapy water for long periods of time can corrode the surface, so wash them quickly! 
Scrub them in baking soda and water paste for tougher stains.

### Aluminum Pots and Pans:

So, this is awkward, while researching I discovered that Baking Soda can damage Aluminum cookware. The alkaline sodium bicarbonate reacts with the aluminum and can cause your pots and pans to discolor. While its okay for a quick rinse, if I ever let it sit in the pots, apparently that's bad. Oof, you learn new things everyday... 

### Glass:

### Stainless Steel:

Overheating Stainless Steel pans for long periods of time can cause discoloration. Say, if you overboil water, that will cause discoloration.
Hmmm, I wonder why the pan looks so discolored after being used by someone. What a mystery...

## Stovetop
### Regular Clean
### Deep Clean
## Any surface above the floor
What is any surface above the floor? Tables, Countertops, Shelves...Any surfaces exposed in the open that are horizontal.
## Floor
For dry messes, the cleaning instructions are nearly identical. Yes, we do have a [robot vacuum cleaner](#robot-vacuum), but he only does so much for the floors that it can reach, and he should really only have to worry about normal household dust, and maybe hair that falls on the ground. We have a broom and dustpan wedged between the fridge and tall shelf, as well as a [compact vacuum cleaner](#vacuum-cleaner). Either one should be plenty for most dry messes. 

Wet messes are more complicated, and different surfaces require different types of attention, detailed below.
### Wooden Floor
### Tiles
## Cloth-based 
### Sofa
### Laundromat
Please do not kill the washer by overloading the high pressured washing machines with soap. We only have 1 good laundromat close by. The laundry machines have seen enough abuse. Please don't perpetuate the cycles of abuse, only the cycles of cleaning.
## Trash
### Food waste
### Dirty containers
### Packaging
## Cleaning Tools
### Robot Vacuum

We have a prototype of the Shark RV850 Robot Vacuum Cleaner, affectionately named Goob. Being a prototype, he's missing the hardware necessary to be as smart as the finished product, but we love him very much. He is programmed to run every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5pm, and will derp around from room to room cleaning up whatever is in his path. He doesn't do a perfect job, but he is a massive help in keeping the house clean.

He will need to be emptied out into the trash can at least once a month. The canister is on the back, which hinges open. The filter inside should also be tapped clean.

### Vacuum Cleaner

This vacuum cleaner is light duty, meant for dust, and maybe some small debris. Luckily, that's pretty much as bad of a dry mess as we can really produce in this house.

After each use, the canister should be emptied into the trash can, and the mesh filter should be washed. Since this is a cleaning tool, the filter should be left to dry in the bucket that's kept near the back door. Once the filter is dry, reassemble the vacuum cleaner so it's ready for the next use.

## The End
I know that if you've never really done this before it can feel daunting, but since asking questions as you go might feel awkward because you might not know where to start, really the best way to learn is to do them. Clean the sofa, your own room, and try cleaning the stove top after you cook. 

At the end of the day, it becomes a habit, and it becomes less daunting. And your roommates won't be hounding you like your mom anymore! Please, we're only 24 and 25, we're not ready to be nagging parents. Anyway, I'm saying that only positive outcomes can occur from cleaning more often. 

**Happy Scrubbing**
