# Casual Guide to Cleaning
Is your standard of cleanliness just "it doesn't *look* dirty, its fine"?
Getting complaints but not sure where to start?
Roommates you lived with before are Lovecraftian fish people from the London sewage?
In this **Casual Guide to Cleaning**, we channel our experiences in childhood trauma to give tips on how to clean properly!

## Dishes
Bacteria will stay alive on surfaces, even clean surfaces, for up to four days. When you leave dishes in the sink, you're building a concoction of bacteria soup.
Which can be the cause of a myriad of gastrointestinal problems. As a completely unrelated side note to bacteria and cross contamination, I get sick easily. *So no pressure, the blood is on your hands~*

When hand washing dishes: 
- Have the water as hot as you can bear (Or wear rubber gloves)
- Use detergent and some sort of scrub or brush so you are ***actually*** removing the food particles with brute force.
- **ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HAND ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE DISHES TO CHECK IF YOU CLEANED THEM PROPERLY!!!**
  - Feel Oily? WASH IT AGAIN
  - Feels a weird wet bump? THAT'S FOOD BITS STUCK ON IT
  - Feel Soapy? UNLESS YOUR DIET includes SOAP, WASH IT AGAIN
- Use a clean dish cloth

How to clean dish cloth: 
- Wash and rinse the cloth after washing it with cleaner
- Microwave for a minute

Wash your hands after touching the dishes, especially days old dishes. Don't cross contaminate.

## Cookware
**Nonstick:**

Nonsticks are great for beginners because they can easily be cleaned with hot water, dish soap, and a soft sponge. 
Soaking Nonsticks in soapy water for long periods of time can corrode the surface, so wash them quickly! 
Scrub them in baking soda and water paste for tougher stains.

### Aluminum Pots and Pans:

So, this is awkward, while researching I discovered that Baking Soda can damage Aluminum cookware. The alkaline sodium bicarbonate reacts with the aluminum and can cause your pots and pans to discolor. While its okay for a quick rinse, if I ever let it sit in the pots, apparently that's bad. Oof, you learn new things everyday... 

### Glass:

### Stainless Steel:

Overheating Stainless Steel pans for long periods of time can cause discoloration. Say, if you overboil water, that will cause discoloration.
Hmmm, I wonder why my pan looks so discolored after being used by someone. What a mystery...

## Stovetop
### Regular Clean
### Deep Clean
## Any surface above the floor
What is any surface above the floor? Tables, Countertops, Shelves...Any surfaces exposed in the open that are horizontal.
## Floor
### Wooden Floor
### Tiles
## Cloth-based 
### Sofa
### Laundromat
Please do not kill the washer by overloading the high pressured washing machines with soap. We only have 1 good laundromat close by. The laundry machines have seen enough abuse. Please don't perpetuate the cycles of abuse, only the cycles of cleaning.
## Trash
### Food waste
### Dirty containers
### Packaging

## The End
I know that if you've never really done this before it can feel daunting, but since asking questions as you go might feel awkward because you might not know where to start, really the best way to learn is to do them. Clean the sofa, your own room, and try cleaning the stove top after you cook. 

At the end of the day, it becomes a habit, and it becomes less daunting. And your roommates won't be hounding you like your mom anymore! Please, we're only 24 and 25, we're not ready to be nagging parents. Anyway, I'm saying that only positive outcomes can occur from cleaning more often. 

**Happy Scrubbing**
