# Casual-Guide-to-Cleaning
Is your standard of cleaniness just "it doesn't *look* dirty, its fine"?
Getting complaints but not sure where to start?
In this **Casual Guide to Cleaning**, we channel our experiences in childhood trauma to give tips on how to clean properly!

## Dishes
Bacteria will stay alive on surfaces, even clean surfaces, for up to four days. When you leave dishes in the sink, you're building a concoction of bacteria soup.
Which can be the cause of a myriad of gastrointestinal problems. As a completely unrelated side note to bacteria and cross contamination, I get sick easily. So no pressure its blood on your hands~ 
When hand washing dishes: 
- Have the water as hot as you can bear (Or wear rubber gloves)
- Use detergent and some sort of scrub or bruch so you are **actually** removing the food particles with brute force.
- Use a clean dish cloth

How to clean dish cloth: 
- Wash and rinse the cloth
- Microwave for a minute

Wash your hands after touching the dishes, especially days old dishes. Don't cross contaminate.

Nonsticks are great for beginners because it can easily be cleaned with hot water, dish soap, and soft sponge. 
Soaking Nonsticks in soap water for long periods of time can corrode the surface. So wash them quickly! 
Scrub them in baking soda and water paste for tougher stains.

Overheating Stainless Steel pans for long periods of time can cause discoloration. Say, if you overboil water, that will cause discoloration.
Hmmm, I wonder why does my pan look so discolored after being used by someone. What a mystery.
